Plant diseases have turned into a dilemma as they can cause significant reductions in both the quality and quantity of agricultural products. Automatic detection of plant diseases is an essential research topic as it may prove beneficial in monitoring large fields of crops, and thus automatically detect the symptoms of diseases as soon as they appear on plant leaves. The proposed system is a software solution for the automatic detection and classification of plant leaf diseases. As a result, in the field of agriculture, disease identification in plants is important. Plants are highly susceptible to diseases that inhibit plant development, which affects the farmer's ecology. The use of an automated disease detection technique is advantageous in detecting a plant disease at an early stage. Plant diseases manifest themselves in various parts of the plant, such as the leaves. It takes a long time to manually diagnose plant disease using leaf photographs. As a result, computational methods must be developed to automate the process of disease detection and classification using leaf images.
