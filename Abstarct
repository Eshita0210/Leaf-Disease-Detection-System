Agricultural productivity is something on which the economy highly depends. This is one of the reasons that disease detection in plants plays a vital role in the agricultural field. If proper care is not taken in this area then it might cause severe effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity, or productivity is affected. Detection of plant diseases through some automatic technique is beneficial as it reduces the large work of monitoring big farms of crops, and at the very early stage itself, it detects the symptoms of diseases. Our agenda is to train all images of leaves concerning the classes, hence when we provide a new image that the model has not seen to view its accuracy and capability in generating or detecting whether that particular image belongs to that particular class of disease. Here, we will use concepts of Deep Learning.
